Observations

3 Data Sets
  - train - 9000 values
  - test - 3000 values
  - validation - 2999 values
  
  
Exploratory Analysis:

  Var1: satisfaction_level 
    - negatively skewed -> majority ofemployees are satisfied

    Observations
       - 3 major clusters
    
    
  Var2: average_monthly_hours
    - bimodal distribution w/ mean = median 
      - 2 peaks are approx at 1st and 3rd Qu.
    
      1st Quartile = 155
      Median = 200
      Mean = 200.8
      3rd Quartile = 245
      
    # of hours based on 9-5: 8*5*4 = 160
      - 1st mode = just going 9-5 everyday
  
    hours/day based on 255 amh: (255/4)/5 = 12.75
      - 2nd mode = 13 hrs/day
      
      Important Charts
         - Scatterplot ~ number_project
         - Scatterplot ~ left
            - strong relationship between people who leave and # of projects/satisfaction level
            


  Var 3: number_project
    - alost normal distribution w/ a slight positive skew 
  
      min: 2
      median: 4
      max: 7
    

         
  Var 4: time_spend_company
    - positively skewed w/ median = 3 -> majority of employees have been at the company for 3 years
    Note: precipitous drop from # of 3rd years to # of 4th years
    
    Important Graphs
      - Line Graph of time vs avg project #
        - significant increase in avg project # from 3-4 years at the company 
      - Scatterplot 
        - shows that cluster of overworked people w/ high # of projects are typicaly 4th and 5th years (times when project # increases significantly)
        - bar graph of NP ~ TSC supports this as the # of people with 5-7 projects are 4th and 5th years
        
        
        
 Var 5: last_evaluation
    min: 0.36
    median: 0.72
    max: 1
    


  Var 6: Work_accident
    - 14.5% of workers have been in an accident
    - accidents are evenly distributed -> not correlated with any variable and rates are spread across departments & average_monthly hours
    
    Important Graphs
      - Scatterplot w/ color = left
        - people that leave after an accident are in the same places (clusters) as those in the scatterplot for amh vs sl
          - work accident probably isn't a very important factor



  Var 7: Promotion Last 5 Years
    - 2.1% of employees were promoted
    - not correlated with any other variable 
    
    Important Graphs
      - Scatterplot
        - promotions aren't clustered together / seem unlinked to AMH worked
      - Tables
        - promotions are evenly distributed among low satisfaction and high satisfaction employees
      - Bar Graph - proportion of promotions for each department
        - Management is 1st
        - marketing is 2nd
        - RandD is 3rd
        


  Var 8: Sales
    - sales department has the most people
    
    Important Graphs
      - Scatterplot
        - people are distributed all over the different departments
      - Bar Graphs
        - people who left were distributed
        
        
  Var 9: Salary
    - salaries are evenly distrbitued vs AMH
    - same % of each salary level is satisfied (SL > 0.5)
    - low salary employees are the ones most likely to leave - 30%
      - overworked + dissatisfied employees are almost all being paid low + medium salaries
    




Risk Factors for leaving
 - low satisfaction level
 - high number of projects + high number of average monthly hours
 - low number of projects + 1st quartile number of average monthly hours (8 hr/day)
 - time spent at company == 3 OR time spent at company >= 4 AND < 6 (period where employees are assigned a large # of projects)
 - low + medium salary -> overworked + low SL
 - low + medium + high salary -> underworked + low SL
      
  
  

  Predictions:
    - logistic regression + decision trees -> same AUC (0.811)
    - random forest -> AUC (0.991)
