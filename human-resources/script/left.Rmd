#Human Resources Analytics  

### Introduction  

At Company X, there has been a recent exodus of some of its brightest and most experienced employees. 

With data provided by the HR department, our primary goal is to understand why a portion of company X's best employees are leaving prematurely. 

And in order to better prepare for future events, our secondary goal is to build a classifier that can accurately predict whether an employee chooses to stay or leave. 


### Data Pipeline



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
